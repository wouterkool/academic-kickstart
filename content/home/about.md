# Hello world!

*To use the worlds resources efficiently, software systems need to make good decisions. I think Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the exciting potential to learn how to do so.*

Currently, I am a first year PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab (AMLAB)](http://amlab.science.uva.nl/), supervised by [Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/). My research focuses on using (Deep) Reinforcement Learning to learn algorithms capable of solving practical (combinatorial) optimization problems.
